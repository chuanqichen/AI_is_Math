    "## Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Python modules are included within the core distribution, and all you have to do is `import` them. \n",
    "However, many more modules are contained in 3rd party packages that must be downloaded and installed first.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python pacakges can be installed by downloading the package source code and then running a special script that comes with the pacakge, `python setup.py install`. But this is not the recommended way to install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage installations and dependencies, most people use a pacakge manager. The most common one is [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) (which replaced `easy_install` some years ago), which is the package manager recommended by the Python organization. _pip_ installs packages that were uploaded (e.g. _deployed_) to [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/), the Python Package Index, which is the main repository for Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, scientific pacakges (such as Numpy and Scipy) sometimes have non-Python dependencies, mostly C and Fortran code, and these dependecies can be hard to compile and link - especially on standard Windows machines. Therefore, [Continuum](http://continuum.io/) started the [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) project. *conda* is an alternative to *pip*, able to install Python packages, but it can also do more, as it can install non-Python software (even *R*). So *conda* can install Python packages with non-Python dependencies much more smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we installed Python using the Anaconda distribution (also by *Continuum*) then we already have *pip* and *conda*.\n",
    "Let's start by updating them (remember that prefixing commands with `!` in the notebook runs them as system commands, so we don't have to open a console window):"
