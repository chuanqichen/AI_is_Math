# Introduction to OpenCV

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that is intended to provide an introduction to OpenCV's Python interface. All notebooks were initially developed and released by [Hannah](https://github.com/handee/opencv-gettingstarted), with some minors changes, code update for python3, and some other customizations provided by me.

The target audience is broad and includes

 * People who have done computer science (maybe to graduate level) but who have not looked at OpenCV before
 * People who are studying other subjects and want to play with computer vision

## Notebooks

The notebooks are divided by the following lessons. 
I also provided the estimated time required to complete each lesson, a link to the source code, and the Google Colab link where anyone can use to follow the lessons and run the examples.
